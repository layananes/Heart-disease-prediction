## Heart Disease Prediction Project!
### This is my first try at a prediction program as I am diving into AI and data science.
- Replaced outliers plots are the box plots I generated **after** cleaning up my data to verify there were no outliers left.
- The "heart dataframe" jupyter notebook file includes the actual code I used to clean up the data, while the "testing new data" file was for me to verify that the duplicates and null data had been dealt with.
