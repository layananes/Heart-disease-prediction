More than half of the patients have no heart disease. (164 to 139) 


- 112 of those who have heart disease are between ages 50 and 70, meaning the chance of heart disease increases as age increases. 

- Rest BP is generally concentrated towards the middle and shows mostly normal values and low correlation. 

- Cholesterol also shows low correlation, with the values being somewhat symmetrical and lying within normal range.

- Max HR is left skewed, though within normal limits. 

- Old Peak is right skewed, though also withing normal limits. 

- Slope is right skewed. since almost half of the values lie at the danger level, a correlation can be seen. 

- Calcium values are right skewed. a good amount of the data lie above danger level, so a correlation can be seen. 

- Ex Ang is right skewed. most report no chest pain during exercise, though a good correlation can be observed with those that do.

- Rest ECG is symmetrical, almost half of the data lie within abnormal limits, though very low correlation is observed. 

- Fbs is right skewed, generally low/normal blood sugar reported

- Chest pain: 105 out of 144 patients who report no chest pain symptoms have heart disease, meaning they have it at a preventable stage but cannot yet report chest pain symptoms. 86 patients have non anginal symptoms, meaning the pain is not related to the heart. 
7 of 23 who report typical chest pain symptoms actually have heart disease, which is a questionable correlation (seems like it's low). 
9 of 50 who report nontypical chest pain symptoms actually have heart disease, which is a very low correlation. 
18 of 86 who report nonanginal chest pain symptoms actually have heart disease, which is a very low correlation. 

- Thalassemia: 37 of 166 who report normal Thalassemia actually have heart disease, which is a very low correlation. 
8 of 117 who report reversable Thalassemia actually have heart disease, which is an extremely low correlation. 
12 of 18 who report reversable Thalassemia actually have heart disease, which is an high correlation. 

- Sex: 114 of the 206 male patients have heart disease, while 25 of the 97 female patients have heart disease. This shows a half to quarter ratio, meaning for every woman, 4.5 men report heart disease (meaning men are twice as likely to have it)

In general: 

Calcium, Old peak, and Ex Ang and slope show correlation with heart disease. Fixed Thalassemia also shows high correlation. All other symptoms lie <1 in correlation.
